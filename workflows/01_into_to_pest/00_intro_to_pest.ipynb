    "The search algorithm used in PEST is the ___Gauss-Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (GLMA)___. The central feature of the PEST engine is the GLMA search algorithm that iteratively optimizes the model parameters to improve its fit to observed data and other objectives. The fit to the observations is hereby expressed through the Measurement Objective Function. In the simplest case, this will be the weighted sum of squares of the residuals between measurement and simulation results:\n",

    "\n",
    " 1. The first line of the TPL file must identify that it is a template file by listing \"`ptf ~`\" where \"`~`\" is a \"parameter delimiter\" that tells PEST where a parameter sits in the file. We used a tilde here but it can be any symbol. __However__, whatever delimiter symbol is listed in the first line must be used consistently throughout that template file.\n",
    " 2. The template file looks exactly like the original model input file __BUT__ parameters are substituted for the  model input(s) that we want PEST to estimate.  Parameters are identified by surrounding the parameter name listed in the PEST control (.pst) file with the delimiter.  For the \"`~`\" delimiter that we used above, and a horizontal K parameter named \"`kc`\" listed as a parameter in a PEST .pst file, the template file would have \"`~   kc ~`\" __wherever that Kh value__ was listed in the original model input file. \n",

    "\n",
    " * The first line on an .ins file must be \"`pif ~`\" where \"`~`\" is a \"marker delimiter\"--a symbol that can be used to identify text to search for.  It is expected on this first line but it's not always used.\n",
    " * The scripting options are extensive but particular. Some options on how to navigate to the numerical data you want to read are:\n",
    "   1. Using a line advance.  PEST starts at the very top the model output file, and you have to move down 1 line to get to the first line that you see in the model output. You can tell PEST to move down the file _`n`_ lines using the `l` character (=lowercase letter l) with a number.  So \"`l1`\" moves down one line, \"`l3`\" moves down 3 lines.  \n",
    "   2. Using the marker delimiter, the INS file can search through a file until it finds a \"primary marker\". For example:  \n",
    "   \"`~VOLUMETRIC BUDGET FOR ENTIRE MODEL~`\" can be used to search for budgets in a LST file  \n",
    "   This is particularly well suited for output files (like a LST file) that have unpredictable lengths.  Note though that PEST will always start at the top of the file and go down, never up and never wrapping once it reaches the end.  This can be a problem when the order of some observations with respect to other observations is not consistent (e.g., some MODPATH output).  When searching for mutiple observations that may vary in order in an output file, it is easiest to have multiple instruction files open the same model output file multiple times so you are always starting at the top of the file (PEST does not mind). \n",
    "   3. Next, you can search for a \"secondary marker\" within a line using the marker delimiter again. This navigates from the left of the line until the secondary marker is found.\n",
    "   4. Once on the line you can specify which columns on a line to extract.  So a line in an instruction file that says '~101  138~ (depth_T2-90)46:58'means that PEST will look for '101  138' in the model output file (with the exact number of spaces between the two numbers) then extract column 46:58 to determine the model output that equates to the target observation 'depth_T2-90' that is listed in the PEST control file.   \n",
    "5. Finally, you can read in whitespace-delimited numerical data using \"`!`\" around the observation name:  \n",
    "   for example, if the output file is:  \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Output file from run 5\n",
    "   Run date: 1/1/2012\n",
    "   Run time: 24.3 hours\n",
    "   Converged in 350 iterations\n",
    "   Head Observations:\n",
    "   H1=33.345 H2=45.34\n",
    "   ...\n",
    "   ```  \n",
    "   The instruction file would be like \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   pif ~\n",
    "    ~Head Observations~\n",
    "    l1 ~H1=~ !h1val! ~H2=~ !h2val!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    " These are only a few of the most commonly used options but more options, and more detail on these, are available in the PEST manual.  \n",

    "   Let's check an instruction file using `INSCHEK`, a handy utility that allows us to check our instruction files without having to do a full PEST run. You can see what INSCHEK is looking for by simply typing 'INSCHEK\" at the command line.  You'll see: \n",
